## Profile

I am a **solution-driven software engineer** focused on building **robust, real-world systems** that operate under real constraints: users, regulations, hardware, scale, and time.

I do not define myself by languages or frameworks.  
I define myself by **ownership**, **delivery**, and **systems that work in production**.

Most of my work has been in **enterprise-grade platforms**, public-sector systems, and mission-critical internal tools.

<summary><strong>Background</strong></summary>

My interest in technology started early through direct interaction with hardware and systems, long before I formally learned to code.

During the COVID period, I discovered programming as a discipline and quickly moved beyond surface-level development into **backend logic, algorithms, and system behavior**.

I am largely self-taught, driven by curiosity and responsibility rather than trends.  
My goal has always been the same: **build systems that matter and actually get used**.

I am still early in my career — but already operating at production scale.
